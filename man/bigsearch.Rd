\description{
Specifies a term-wise search (like \code{\link{searchbyterm}}) and requests 
that all available  records be made available for download as a 
tab-delimited text file.
}
\details{
\code{\link{bigsearch}} allows you to request records as a 
tab-delimited text file. This is the best way to access a large number of 
records, such as when your search results indicate that >1000 records are
available. You will be notified by email when your records are ready 
for download.
}
\section{Reading data}{

We suggest reading data in with \code{fread()} from the package 
\pkg{data.table} - as it's very fast for the sometimes large datasets 
you will get from using this function, and is usually robust to 
formatting issues.

\examples{
\dontrun{
# replace "big@search.luv" with your own email address
bigsearch(genus = "ochotona", rf = "pikaRecords", email = "big@search.luv")

# Pass in curl options for curl debugging
library(crul)
bigsearch(genus = "ochotona", rfile = "pikaRecords", 
  email = "big@search.luv", config=verbose())

# Use more than one year query
bigsearch(class = "aves", year = c(">=1976", "<=1986"), 
          rfile = "test-bigsearch1", email = "big@search.luv")
