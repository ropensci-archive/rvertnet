\description{
There are a variety of ways to search VertNet
}
\section{Search by term}{


Search for \emph{Aves} in the state of \emph{California}, limit to 10 records, e.g.:

\code{searchbyterm(class = "Aves", state = "California", lim = 10, 
verbose = FALSE)}

Search for \emph{Mustela nigripes} in the states of \emph{Wyoming} or \emph{South Dakota},
limit to 20 records, e.g.:

\code{searchbyterm(genus = "Mustela", specificepithet = "nigripes", 
   state = "(wyoming OR south dakota)", limit = 20, verbose=FALSE)}
}

\section{Big data}{

Specifies a termwise search (like \code{searchbyterm()}), but requests that all
available records  be made available for download as a tab-delimited
text file.

\code{bigsearch(genus = "ochotona", rf = "pikaRecords", 
email = "big@search.luv")}
}

\section{Spatial search}{

\code{spatialsearch(lat = 33.529, lon = -105.694, radius = 2000, limit = 10, 
verbose = FALSE)}
}

\section{Full text search}{

Find records using a global full-text search of VertNet archives.

\code{vertsearch(taxon = "aves", state = "california")}
}

\section{No results?}{


It's possible to get no results when requesting data from VertNet,
then run the same function again 10 seconds later, and you do get a result.
I'm not sure why this is, something having to do with Vertnet's
infrastucture that I'm not aware of. Point is, if you are sure
you haven't made any mistakes with the parameters, etc., then
simply run the function call again.
